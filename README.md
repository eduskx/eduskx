# Hey, my name is Eduard! 👋🏻

I’m an enthusiastic Frontend Developer with a dual degree in Business Informatics from the Schwarz Gruppe. 🎓 During my studies, I discovered my passion for frontend development and gained valuable practical experience through initial projects.

After graduation, it became clear to me: I wanted to dive even deeper into the field and further develop my skills. That’s why I completed an extensive Udemy course and decided to join an intensive bootcamp at “neue fische.” Here, I deepened my knowledge of modern web technologies and developed new skills that will advance my career as a Web Developer. 💻

I’m excited to apply this passion and my knowledge to exciting projects and continuously develop myself further!
